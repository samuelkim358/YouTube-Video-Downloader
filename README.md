# YouTube-Video-Downloader
A small executable made in python to download YouTube videos up to 2160p.
The executable was made so that you dont need to install ffmpeg.
The app only downloads in .webm extension. If the selected quality is not available it will download in the next highest quality available.
Feel free to use my python code or the exe as you want.
